# Image Processing

## Overview
Various techniques in image processing and computer vision using Python. Consisting of three main components:

1. **Histogram of Image**: Analyzing and manipulating image histograms for tasks such as contrast enhancement and histogram equalization.
2. **Image Smoothing & Edge Detection**: Implementing image smoothing to reduce noise and edge detection to highlight significant features in images.
3. **Image Transformation**: Applying various transformations to images including scaling, rotating, and translating, as well as more complex operations like affine and perspective transformations.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "Natural Images" by Prasun Roy, available on Kaggle. It is a comprehensive collection of natural images that are ideal for experimenting with different image processing techniques.
